The main goal of this project is just to have some fun and parsing those tips and tricks created by John. This project isn't official. If you have any question, you can talk directly to through his [twitter](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) or at [swiftbysundell.com](https://www.swiftbysundell.com).

In this repo, you will not see any trick (just the use of them :P), I recommend you to access the original repo and star it.
